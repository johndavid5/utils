/utils/command_line/mid:
------------------------
A command-line utility "mid", written in C, which prints the middle of a
text file, like "head" prints the first N lines and "tail" prints the last
N lines.

For example, "mid -n 5 10 declaration.txt" prints lines 5 through 10 
preceeded by lines numbers.

/utils/command_line/isql
------------------------
Contains isql_pdo.php, a web app that runs SQL queries and
pretty prints the result set.  Often preferable to using
command-line sql.
