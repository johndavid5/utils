For my blog article about the "mid" utility, visit

mid.pl: This command-line utility will print out specified
lines in the middle of a file.

To run this, you need to have Perl installed on your system, and make
sure the Perl interpreter is in your execute PATH.  

An example of running this from the command-line:
$ perl mid.pl -n02 8 10 declaration.txt

The behavior should be the same as if you compile and run 
mid.c as an executable, except, of course, much slower.
