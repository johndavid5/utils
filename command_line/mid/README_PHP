For my blog article about the "mid" utility, visit
  http://thetenacioustechie.com/blog/the-case-of-the-missing-midsection/

mid.php: This command-line utility will print out specified
lines in the middle of a file.

To run this, you need to have PHP installed on your system, and make
sure the PHP interpreter is in your execute PATH.  

An example of running this from the command-line:
$ php mid.php -n02 8 10 declaration.txt

The behavior should be the same as if you compile and run 
mid.c as an executable, except, of course, much slower.
