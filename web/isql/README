isql_pdo.php:
-------------
 An Interactive SQL web app that uses PHP's PDO to execute
 queries and display their output.

 <1> Uses obsolete 20th Century HTML FRAMES to display query info in top frame, 
 and the executed query output at the bottom frame.

 <2> Uses the Strategy design pattern so that output can be in the form 
 of an HTML table, JSON, XML, CSV, tab-delimited, 
 even SQL INSERT statements.  For SQL insert statements,
 you must provide the name of the table.

DEPENDENCIES:
-------------
QueryManager.php
jutils.inc.php
style4.css (hope you like robin-egg blue)

TO GET THIS TO WORK:
--------------------
 1. Install a LAMP or WAMP or MAMP stack.
 2. Install PDO and pdo_mysql.
    (plus pdo_your_favorite_db_server for other DB server types...)
 3. Fill in appropriate g_assoc_servers[] entries in the JavaScript section
 of isql_pdo.php where it says...

      /* 
      * -- FILL IN YOUR SERVER INFO HERE --
      * --

 ...so they display themselves in the "server:" dropdown.
 4. Point your browser to the location where Apache expects
    to find isql_pdo.php, e.g., http://localhost/isql/isql_pdo.php.
 4. Fill in a Query or Queries terminated with ";" in the large
    Queries textarea in the top frame.
 5. Hit the SUBMIT QUERY button.
 6. The output will appear in the bottom frame as HTML,
    or JSON, XML, CSV, tab-delimited, or SQL INSERT statements. 
 7. If you did in UPDATE or INSERT rather than a SELECT,
    it should print out "x row(s) affected" at the bottom
    rather than the result set.

TODO: 
-----
 <1> Update to 21st Century, that is, without using
 HTML FRAMES:
  <A> Use AJAX to fill in the query output at the bottom
    of a single page without having to refresh the entire
    page, and/or...
  <B> Use a SlickGrid jQuery widget as an optional "output".
